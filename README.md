# rasp-info-display
## small project which will be built mostly in PHP or Python (Backend) and React.js (Frontend).
This is the repo for my little rasp-info-display-project. I want to display stuff like the current weather, when to leave to catch the next tram and other shizzle.
The Rasp + Display will be put up next to my frontdoor.
